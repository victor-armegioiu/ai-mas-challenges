# AI-MAS Lab challenge 

This repo provides solutions for problems 0 and 1. The solution for problem 0 is simply a pdf file that can be found in the appropriate folder.

With regards to problem 1, I created a dueling deep q-learning agent in a separate file that can be found in p1's folder. I also slightly modified the `test_agent.py` script in order to make the state processing part easier for the agent. The solution may be tested by simply running `python3 test_agent.py`. The specifcs of the algorithm may be found in the form of comments in `test_agent.py` and `dqn_agent.py`.
